# exam-generator-api

#### Description

This project is an API built with Java and Spring Framework which returns data in Json format. This project is meant to allow Professors to create Courses that may contain questions, choices and answers for the questions, which Students would be able to access later, pretty similar to Google Forms, but in a light version. In it, I used a Docker container to create a MySQL image and JPA with Hibernate to create the repository of my application, I also had to use Hibernate Query Language(HQL) for creating a customized queries. This project is full documented with SpringFox so it is easier for people to understand and utilize its endpoints.
